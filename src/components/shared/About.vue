                <p>What you saw on Home is kinda like man-made work titles, basically a drop in the ocean. Oh and by the way, savoir faire is a distant synonym to portfolio or resume. Yeah don't expect me to use a common name like everyone does. That said, I am a thinker but above all a born again christian full of creativity. Some of my hobbies include 
                    <ul class="mt-0 mt-sm-4">
                        <li>Watching movies</li>
                        <li>Jogging especially evening jogs</li>
                        <li>reading self-improvement books</li>
                        <li class="mb-0 mb-sm-4">cooking</li>
                    </ul>
                     I love animation clips because of the almost endless possibilities portrayed by them.<br/>Now to the serious stuff, I can offer leadership and guidance when need arises,fit in a team and try to relate with each person's point of view. Stick around and you will learn more about me.
